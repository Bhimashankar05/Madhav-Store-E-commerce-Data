# Madhav_Store_PowerBI_Dashboard

I designed a Power BI dashboard for Madhav Store to track and analyze online sales data across India and performed the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Reviewed the online sales dataset, analyzed key data types, and identified missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the data by handling missing values and ensuring proper formatting for dashboard visualization.
3. **Key Metrics Calculation**: Calculated important metrics, such as total sales, regional sales performance, and customer purchase patterns.
4. **Dashboard Design**: Designed interactive Power BI visuals to track sales trends, customer behavior, and regional performance.
5. **Visualization**: Used Power BI tools to visualize sales data, trends, and relationships between key metrics like sales and customer segments.
6. **Documentation**: Compiled detailed documentation on the dashboard for clarity, ensuring it’s ready for sharing and use by Madhav Store’s team.
